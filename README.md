# Product list with cart challenge (frontendmentor.io)

I'm using frontend mentor to practice my tailwind, javascript, typescript and HTML skills. I know some of the colors are currently off. I'm using the colors specified in the figma file, but they don't look the same as in the preview for some reason.

You can find the challenge here:

I've deployed my progress to netlify so you can see my progress:
